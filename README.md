# **Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning (Deployed on Hugging Face & Render)**

* This project detects and classifies brain tumors from MRI scans using a deep learning model.
* The model is hosted on Hugging Face, and the frontend web application is deployed on Render, providing a full end-to-end machine learning solution.

## **Overview**

The application allows users to upload an MRI brain scan and instantly receive a tumor detection result.
The backend model performs image classification and returns predictions through an API endpoint, while the frontend handles user interaction and visualization.

## **What I Learned**

* How to train and test a deep learning model for medical image classification.

* Hosting machine learning models on Hugging Face Spaces.

* Building and deploying a Flask-based or HTML/JS frontend on Render.

* Connecting frontend and backend using REST APIs.

* Managing dependencies and environment setup using requirements.txt and Procfile.

* Understanding deployment workflow and scalability concepts.

## **Tools & Libraries**

* Python, Flask, NumPy, OpenCV, PyTorch, YOLOv12

* Hugging Face Spaces (Model Hosting)

* Render (Frontend Deployment)

* HTML / CSS / JavaScript

## **Architecture**
```
User → Render Frontend → Hugging Face API → Deep Learning Model → Prediction → Render UI
```

* Backend (Hugging Face): [Add your Hugging Face Space or API URL here]

## **Future Enhancements**

* Add explainability features (Grad-CAM heatmaps).

* Improve UI with real-time prediction visualization.

* Extend model to classify multiple tumor types.
